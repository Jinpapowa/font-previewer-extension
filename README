This is the code for a Chrome extension that helps you preview
how fonts from the Google Fonts API look on existing webpages.

There is currently no API to query the fonts directory for metadata
on the fonts, so this extension is manually updated based on the Google
site every few weeks.

The manual update process is:
- Download CSS files from http://code.google.com/webfonts, save to fonts.css
- Replace '::Menu' in fonts.css with ''
- Copy JSON from http://code.google.com/webfonts/preview, save to fonts.js

The "testing" process is:
- Open a webpage, try to apply a font, try to change the style, try to apply
a different font, try to reset, try to apply another.
- Good webpages are: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox (Basics)
                     http://www.mysparebrain.com/svgjs (Tests SVG issue)

Here are some features that I would like to add in the future:
- Automate the update process somehow
- Filter font list by serif/sans serif/etc, like on Web Fonts directory
- Sort font list (like on Web Fonts directory)

If you make improvements to this (like the suggestions above),
please let me know.
