This is the code for a Chrome extension that helps you preview
how fonts from the Google Fonts API look on existing webpages.

There is currently no API to query the fonts directory for metadata
on the fonts, so this extension is manually updated based on the Google
site every few weeks.

The manual update process is:
- Download CSS from http://code.google.com/webfonts
- Replace '::Menu' in the CSS with ''
- Copy JSON from http://code.google.com/webfonts/preview

If you make improvements to this that other users may benefit from,
please let me know.
